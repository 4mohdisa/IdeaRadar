    description: "An innovative mobile application that uses computer vision and machine learning to scan grocery receipts, track purchasing patterns, and suggest personalized recipes based on ingredients you already have. The app learns dietary preferences over time and helps reduce food waste while simplifying meal planning.",
    body_text: `I had this idea for an app that scans your grocery receipts and learns what you typically buy. Then it suggests recipes based on ingredients you already have or are likely to buy. It could also track prices and suggest cheaper alternatives.

The AI could learn your dietary preferences and cooking skill level over time. For example, if you always buy chicken breast but never buy complex spices, it would suggest simple chicken recipes.

Key features:
- Receipt scanning using phone camera
- Ingredient inventory tracking
- Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- Price tracking and shopping list optimization
- Dietary preference learning (vegan, keto, etc.)
- Meal planning calendar
- Integration with grocery delivery apps

Monetization:
- Freemium model (limited recipes free, premium for unlimited)
- Affiliate commissions from grocery delivery apps
- Premium features like advanced meal planning

I think this could work because everyone hates wasting food and figuring out what to cook. The receipt scanning makes it unique because it requires zero manual input.`,

    body_text: `LinkedIn has become unbearable with all the cringe motivational posts, fake stories, and engagement bait. What if there was a browser extension that uses AI to filter all that out?

The extension would:
- Hide posts with common cringe patterns ("I'm humbled to announce...")
- Keep job postings, company updates, and actual professional content
- Let you customize what you consider "cringe"
- Show a daily digest of actual useful content
- Track time saved from not scrolling

Could charge $5/month for premium features like:
- Custom filters
- Mobile app version
- Save filtered posts for later
- Export job listings

There are 900M+ LinkedIn users and many hate the current state of the platform. This scratches a real itch.`,

    body_text: `Every dog owner in my neighborhood is always asking for walker recommendations. There's Rover and Wag, but they're not great for finding local, trusted walkers.

My idea: A hyper-local dog walking marketplace
- Focuses on neighborhoods, not cities
- Walkers must be verified by 3+ neighbors
- Real-time GPS tracking during walks
- Instant booking (like Uber for dog walks)
- Walker ratings and reviews
- Insurance coverage included
- Recurring walk scheduling
- Group walks at discount

Take 20% commission from each walk. Start with one neighborhood, expand slowly with word of mouth.

The trust factor is key - walkers vouched for by neighbors you know. Could work in suburban areas where people know each other.`,
